# Patterns

Welcome to the `patterns` folder of the Elementary C++ Explorations project! This folder contains various C++ programs that demonstrate different patterns using loops.

## Patterns Included

1. **Number Patterns**: Programs demonstrating patterns using numbers.
2. **Character Patterns**: Programs demonstrating patterns using characters.

## How to Use

Each pattern program is contained in its own file and can be compiled and executed using a C++ compiler. You can use an IDE like Visual Studio Code, CLion, or an online compiler to run these programs.
